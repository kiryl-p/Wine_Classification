# Wine_Classification
module 4/5 project in Flatiron School (ds-042219)

Modeled different machine learning algorithms to solve binary classification problem:  
Diagnosed usability of a given data set;  
Processed feature engineering;  
Maximized evaluation metrics by tuning hyperparameters using GridSearchCV technique;  
Solved classification exercise to find a best-performing model.
